· agree with the latter in taking eum as a preposition,
justifying the order of words thus: In vitiis bono the juxta·
position is antithetioal. evidently more so than eum vitiis
mm econtra, eam vitiis bona e. mea would preserve the
oontrast of words, but give an extravagant end unmeaning
emphasis to aaa.

S. 1. 6. 87. at loe. There is the same uncertainty about this
reading as about Epod. ix. 17.

S. l. 6. 96. temtos. I should prefer the v. l. honestos, but that
probably the two words may be synonymous.

S. 1. 9-64. prensare. This is the reading of the old Montpelier
MS. Orell. p. 919.

S. 2. 2. 2. Ofella. Thisis aeonjeetural correction of the MSS.
reading Ofellus, proposed by Bentley, adopted by Orelli, on
the grounds that Ofellus is a form probably due to copyists
‘quibus terminatio a in viro falsa videretur ;' that it ooeurs
nowhere else, though the gentile name Ofellius and the
cognomen Ofella do ocour; that, further, the true form is·
given in the St. Gallen MS. On the other hand, Ritter
asserts that Orelli is mistaken‚ and that the MS. in question
gives Ofellus3 also he supposes the name te be Ossan, which

. is not unlikely in the case of a Venusian former. It might
perhaps be questioned whether itis a personal name, though
no doubt a real person is intended. The use of Ofella in
Martial for simple fingal fare suggests that it may be a
made-up and descriptiva name3 in such a case the form
analogous to Roman usage would surely be adopted.

S. 2. 3. 119. tinearum. I note in v. l. the form approved by
' Wagner.
