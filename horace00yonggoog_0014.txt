vi INTRODUGHON.

I may make a remark here upon Bentley's reading at r. 6.
melem-certainly not one of his happy conjectures—that it ia
founded on a wrong interpretation: Hanc (v. 7) is undoubtedly
gorerned byjuvot3 the intervening clauses (nactaque-palmaque
—eceltit) are in parenthesis, and eperogetic, a particular descrip
tion in terma subordinate to the general idea. The construction is
of the kind illustrated in Hermann’s Ed. of Sophocles’ ‘Antigone’
533; and Lobock on the ‘Ajax,' p. 295.

0.1.13.6. Ι read meet. Orelli's reading amomi seems to
involve positive error equally with his interpretation of
Epod. ὀ. 87.

C. 1.26.10. possunt has indeed authority; but prosum is well
maintained by Orelli.

Ο.2.13. 16. I noto Lachmann’s eonjecture timetur as highly
probabls.

(1.2. lata decretae. v. l. demptae b. Τ. But Κ. reads die·
criptae, and rightly, Ι suspect. There is the same variety of
readings in Cic. Inr. L m 49, and in Livy, mi. 34. In
both places it is pretty clear that discripte, damnata, ought
to be read. Disce-ibo and its formatione hare evidently been
confounded with deser. (see 1ong'snote,Verr.r. 24). Cp.
Cic. in Cat. III. iv. 8; pro Plane. xviii. 45; de Dirin. I.
xvii. 31. And this may have led to the substitution in
some passages of doecre, where the idea of ‘separation'
or ‘distinction’ was required, which deciplas would not l
naturally express.
