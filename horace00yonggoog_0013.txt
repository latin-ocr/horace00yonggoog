INTRODUOTION.

-ooe-o ·

Tan favourable reoeption aooorded to my recent octavo edition
of Horaoe enoouragea the publication of thia volume.

Allowanoe being made for some ementiore, and greater aeau-
raey, it reprodurea in ita main features the aame text3 and
supplies, with additions, the aame marginal apparatus. In purity
of text and the novel feature of eide-referenoes, it thus claime
a preference over existing editions.

The aeleotlist of various readings eomprieee all which have
either intrineio merit of their own or fair ΜΒ. authority, or which
bear in any way upon moot points. They aro taken from the
aelectione of Orelli, and (as to the Odes) from the later and more

minute list of Keller and Holder; alno from a partial examina·
tion of the MS. in Quaen's College,01ford, and the Harleian
collection in the Britiah Museum.

Ire nnn mar Onn I venture, following Stallbaum‚ to arrange
the two first linea aa prefatory to the rest, and the two last aa
the complementa of the etanza. Talon in this order the quatraine
end eaeh witha suitahle pauae; the second (vv. 7-10) has ita two
antitheses, the third and fourth balance each other; the only
stanna fairly broken is the penultimate one at v. 30.
